# AWS-EC2-WordPress

Prerequisites:

* Create AWS RSA Pair key (pem) - wordpressKey
* Create S3 bucket for backend of terraform - lab-tfstate-bucket
* You need to export in the OS shell your AWS Keys, which are NOT hardcoded in the code here, due to security reasons.

Once this is done and you have access to AWS via CLI, should be able to deploy the resources via terraform.

Enjoy.
